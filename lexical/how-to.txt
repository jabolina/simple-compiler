The file .mll contains the lexical rules used in the lexical analyzer. The tokens are written in 
brazilian portuguese.


The rules are then transformed in a finite deterministic automata, and a new .ml file is generated,
this file contains all the transitions in the automata. To do this, execute:

> ocamllex lexical.mll

To use the automata is necessary to compile the file:

> ocamlc -c lexical.ml

The compiled file will generate two files, to use in cli, for example, just import the .cmo file. 
Then, call the fuction defined inside the rules file, in this case, the fuction is token.

=================================================================================

After compiling the file and generating the .cmo and .cmi files, you can use the loader file to use 
the lexical analyzer, passing or a string or a path to file.

Example:

#use "loader.ml";;

analyze_path "path/to/some/dot/c/file/this.c"

or

analyze_str "while(1) {x = 1;}"


This will return a list of all tokens that was found in the string/file.
